DESIGN
    Your goal is to gain trust to convince people to attend your sermon.     
    -getting to know a person (facts about them)
        - talking with them
        - spending time with them
        - hhearing about them from other people
    -building trust with the person (your relationship with them)
        - do things for them
        - listen to them
        - make them feel seen
        - having their back
    
    The biggest resource the players have to manage is their TIME.

    The player screen is just you at a doorway. You knock or leave. (to the next house, next neighborhood or a specific person)

    Trust - how they feel about you (in order to get them to go to a sermon)
    Tolerance - indicator of how much they're willing to talk with you
    Emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, anger (how you react to their emotions is a thing)
    Topics: them, you, Christianity (more topics will be added later) - you can only use a topic once during a conversation unless you do...
    Perform: song, magic trick, joke

MAYBE
    Reputation - modifier
    when they pop resistance, have 1 in <resistance value> chance to lower resistance (no lower than 1)
